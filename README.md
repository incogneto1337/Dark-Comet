Usage of Dark Comet RAT
1. Downloading Dark Comet

Dark Comet can still be found on various websites and forums, although it's not recommended to download or use it for malicious purposes. Always ensure to download software from legitimate sources.
2. Setting Up the RAT

    Install Dark Comet: Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Dark Comet on your machine.

    Create a New Server:
        Open Dark Comet.
        Navigate to the "Server Module" section.
        Select "Full Editor" to configure the RAT server.

    Configure the Server:
        Network Settings: Enter the IP address or DNS name and the port number that the server will use to connect back to the controller.
        Module Startup: Configure the server to start automatically with Windows.
        Keylogger: Enable the keylogging functionality if required.
        Surveillance: Configure webcam and microphone settings if needed.

    Build the Server:
        After configuring all settings, click "Build" to create the server executable.
        The server executable is the file that needs to be run on the target machine.

3. Deploying the Server

    Social Engineering: Use social engineering techniques to trick the target into running the server executable. This could be through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or other deceptive methods.

    Executing the Server: Once the target executes the server file, the RAT will connect back to your Dark Comet control panel.

4. Controlling the Remote Machine

    Connection: When the target machine connects back to the controller, you will see it listed in the Dark Comet interface.
    Remote Control: Use the available features to control the remote machine, such as accessing files, recording keystrokes, capturing screenshots, or controlling the webcam.

Example Configuration Steps

    Open Dark Comet:
        Launch Dark Comet on your machine.

    Go to Server Module:
        Navigate to Server Module -> Full Editor.

    Network Settings:
        Set your IP or DNS:

        plaintext

No-IP or DynDNS: example.no-ip.org

Set your port:

plaintext

        Port: 1604

    Build the Server:
        After configuring the settings, click Build -> Build Server.

    Social Engineering:
        Send the server executable to the target via email or other methods.

Ethical and Legal Considerations

Warning: Using Dark Comet RAT or any similar tool for unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission from the owner of the system before performing any actions. Unauthorized use can result in severe legal consequences.

For Legal and Ethical Usage:

    Penetration Testing: Use tools like these only in controlled environments and with proper authorization.
    Education and Training: Demonstrate the tool in educational settings to teach about cybersecurity threats and defense mechanisms.

Understanding how Dark Comet RAT works can help in developing better defenses against such tools and ensuring the security of systems against unauthorized access.
